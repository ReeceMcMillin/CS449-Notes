# Chapter 4 - Fundamentals of Software Design

- **Software Design**: the creative process of transforming a problem described by the requirements specification into a software solution
  - **High-Level Design**
    - software architecture
    - overall structure
    - relations among components
    - properties of components/relations
  - **Low-Level Design**
    - logical, detailed design of individual components
- Software design is a heuristic, sloppy process
  - a good solution may only be subtly different from a poor one
- In agile development, software design is seldom a separate phase as in the waterfall model
  - intertwined with other activities
  - developers make many design decisions while coding
