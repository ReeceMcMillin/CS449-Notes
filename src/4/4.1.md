# Basic Design Principles

Overview:
  - [Modularity](#modularity): software design should be modularized.
  - [Cohesion](#cohesion): software modules should aim for **high cohesion**.
  - [Coupling](#coupling): software modules should aim for **loose coupling**.
  - [Encapsulation](#encapsulation): software modules should encapsulate data and related operations.
  - [Information Hiding](#information-hiding): software modules should hide implementation details from their clients.
  - [Separation of Concerns](#separation-of-concerns): software modules should separate different concerns into distinct modules such that each module addresses one concern.

## Modularity

> **Modularity**
> 
> The degree to which the components of a system are separated.

A modular design divides complex software into uniquely named components (modules), which supports the "divide and conquer" approach for solving a complex problem by breaking it into manageable modules.

Main mechanism for software modularization:
  - methods/functions
  - classes
  - interfaces
  - packages

Drawbacks to non-modularized code:
  - inflexible to changes in requirements
  - code snippets aren't reusable
  - code isn't unit-testable

Primary concerns of modular design:
  - **decomposability**
    - the extent to which the problem can be broken into sub-problems with simple relations
  - **composability**
    - the extent to which the modular solutions to the sub-problems can be assembled as a solution to the *whole* problem
  - adaptability
  - reusability
  - discontinuity
    - deletion of a module should not affect other modules
  - continuity
    - a requirements change affects as few modules as possible

In general, a modular design should comply with the [Open-Closed Principle](../5/5.5.md#open-closed-principle). It should make modules testable and confine runtime exceptions and errors to very few modules from a QA perspective.

Modularity provides the foundation for each of the principles that follow.

## Cohesion

Software modules are containers of elements
  - a method is a container of statements
  - a class is a container of
    - instance variables
    - class variables
    - constructors
    - methods

> **Cohesion**
> 
> The degree to which the elements contained in a module belong together.
