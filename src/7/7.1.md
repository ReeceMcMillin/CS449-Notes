Code smells are not bugs, only indicators that some piece of code may deserve a closer look. Code smells follow a few categories[^further-reading]:
  - Bloaters
    - classes or methods that are too big or complex
      - large class
      - long method
      - long parameter list
  - Non-object-orientation
    - incomplete or incorrect application of OO principles
      - switch statements
      - methods are all static
  - Change preventers
    - a change made in one place entails many changes in other places
      - shotgun surgery
        - a single change must be made to multiple classes simultaneously
      - divergent change
        - many changes are needed to a single class
  - Dispensables
    - unneeded or pointless code
      - dead code
      - duplicate code
      - data class
  - Couplers
    - excessive coupling between modules
      - inappropriate intimacy
      - middleman
        - class that only performs one action and delegates work to other classes
      - message chains
        - `v.a().b().c().d()`
