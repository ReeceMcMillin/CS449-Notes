# Named Refactorings

The noun definition of refactoring corresponds to the named refactorings. Examples include:
  - "Move Method"
  - "Rename Method"
  - "Extract Interface"

Martin Fowler's classification of refactorings consists of six categories:
  - composing methods
  - moving features between objects
  - organizing data
  - simplifying conditional expressions
  - making method calls simpler
  - dealing with generalization

Page 193 (Table 7.2) has a huge list of specific examples!

### Refactorings for Duplicate Code

"Extract Method" - any differences can be accounted for by a parameter.

Multiple similar or identical methods may be merged into one with parameters to capture any differences.

### Inverses of Refactorings

|            Extract Class            |            Inline Class             |
|          Remove Middle Man          |            Hide Delegate            |
| Replace Inheritance with Delegation | Replace Delegation with Inheritance |

### Refactorings and Design Principles

Refactoring is widely recognized as a design activity or a step in the design process. This is because code smells indicate a violation of one or more design principles. There are thus refactorings for cleaning up specific code smells.

Page 197 has a table full of design principles and associated named refactorings for reference.
