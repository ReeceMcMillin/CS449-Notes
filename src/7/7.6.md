# Refactoring for Encapsulation/Information Hiding

Main refactorings:
  - Move Field
  - Move Method
  - Hide Method
  - Encapsulate Downcast
  - Encapsulate Field
  - Encapsulate Collection
  - Hide Delegate
  - Self-Encapsulate Field

Book example: `CardManager` class has method `updateLimit()` which has direct access to an instance variable in `Card` class. Hiding the instance variable and providing [setters and getters](/5/5.4.md#accessors-and-mutators) within `Card` would be a valuable refactoring.
