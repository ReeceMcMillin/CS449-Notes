# Refactoring for Loose Coupling

Consider a client-server model that looks like the following:

```java
class Client {
    private Server server;
}
```

In this example, `Client` interacts *directly* with `Server` In other words, they are tightly coupled. It may be better to extract an abstract interface from `Server` that `Client` can interact with.

Recall this [example](../4/4.1#basic-example) from Chapter 4:

```java
public class Client {
    public void bar(D d) {
        E e = d.getE();
        e.doTheThing();
    }
}
```

`bar(d)` is tightly coupled to both `D` and `E`.

`D` must *produce* `E`, but `e.doIt()` is still fully contained within `bar(d)`. Recall that this violates the Law of Demeter.

To reduce this coupling, we might remove the intermediate `D` object as follows:

```java
public class Client {
    public void bar(E e) {
        e.doTheThing();
    }
}
```

We may also *hide* the delegate[^hide-delegate] by giving `D` a method that calls the function from `E` itself. This means `foo` is no longer talking to `E` (the "friend of a friend"), only `D`.

```java
public class Client {
    public void bar(D d) {
        d.doTheThingOnE();
    }
}
```

Notice that this creates a middleman structure, which is itself a code smell. That doesn't mean a middleman structure is always a bad idea! A middleman may be used to avoid interclass dependencies or created on purpose (Proxy, Decorator patterns).
