# Inheritance and Polymorphism (p. 121)

A subclass:
    - inherits all the features from its superclass
    - can modify certain inherited features
      - achieved through method overriding

## Meanings of Inheritance: Module vs. Type View

> **Module View**
> 
> ---
> 
> A subclass describes an extension of its superclass from the perspective of reusing the superclass's code.
- Problems can arise when a designer
  - uses the module view without a meaningful *is-a* relationship
  - does not observe the polymorphism and dynamic binding semantics

### Example: `Stack<E>` as a subclass of `Vector<E>` (p. 123)
- `Stack<E>` inherits methods from `Vector<E>` that violate the Stack's LIFO principle
  - `add(0, element)` adds to bottom of stack
  - `remove(0) removes bottom of stack
- A better design would replace inheritance with composition (p. 123)

> **Type View**
> 
> ---
> 
> A subclass describes a subtype of the superclass type.

- For example, `int` might be a subtype of `long` or `double`.
- The set of objects of a superclass subsumes the set of objects of a subclass.
- More aligned with the semantics of polymorphism than module view
- Generally preferred to module view
- Consistent with ADTs as the class foundation
  - A subclass's ADT is a subtype of its superclass's ADT

### Example: Square vs. Rectangle (p. 123, 125)
`Square` as a subclass of `Rectangle`
  - in math, a square is a special type of rectangle
  - if `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`, it must override `Rectangle`'s `setWidth()` and `setHeight()` methods.
  - since the classes behave so differently, the *is-a* relationship isn't ideal.
  - there should be **no** inheritance relation

> **Subtype**
> 
> ---
> 
> Data type \\(t_2\\) is a subtype of data type \\(t_1\\) if every value of \\(t_2\\) can be assigned to a variable of \\(t_1\\).

Consider inheritance's relationship with the Open-Closed Principle:
  - a subclass may revise an inherited method through overriding while adding new methods.
    - open for extension through inheritance
    - closed for modification through overriding

## Subcontracting

A subclass is a *subcontractor* of its parent class, meaning it must satisfy *at least* the same contract. If you subcontract, you must be willing to do the job under the original conditions, no less.

## Pre/Postcondition of Method Overriding

Consider a server \\(A\\) with a descendent \\(A_1\\).
As a result of dynamic binding, a call from client \\(C\\) may be served by either \\(A\\) *or* \\(A_1\\) at runtime. This means that, to uphold an ancestor class's contract, the descendent must enforce either an equal or weaker precondition or an equal but stronger postcondition.

> **Subcontracting Rule of Inheritance**

> ---
> 
> An overriding method that has either
> - an equal or weaker precondition
> - an equal or stronger postcondition
> 
> causes no harm to a client call that relies on the original.

So in essence, subcontracting is just a strategy that guarantees descendants of a server do not break a contract expected by a client.

## Covariance/Contravariance for Method Overriding
```java
class AnimalShelter {
    Animal getAnimalForAdoption();
    void putAnimal(Animal animal);
}

class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
    Cat getAnimalForAdoption();
    void putAnimal(Object animal);
}
```
- `getAnimalForAdoption()` follows a **covariant** subtyping relationship
  - `Cat extends Animal`
  - `CatShelter extends AnimalShelter`
  - considered **overriding**
- `putAnimal()` follows a **contravariant** subtyping relationship
  - `Animal extends Object`
  - `CatShelter.putAnimal()` takes a more general argument than the class it extends from
  - considered **overloading**
