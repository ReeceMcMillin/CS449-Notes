# Overview

These are notes for certain chapters in Dr. Dianxiang Xu's book *Modern Software Engineering: Principles & Practices*.

I'm writing this a few days before the final exam as one part of my prep strategy. Since I'm only re-reading relevant chapters, there will be pretty heavy omissions and missing sections. It'd be nice to pad this out as a resource for future students, but I'll have to return the book less than a week from the time of writing. If you happen to come across this and want to contribute your own notes, feel free to [fork the repo or open a PR!](https://github.com/ReeceMcMillin/CS449-Notes)
