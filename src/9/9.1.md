# Verification and Validation (p. 272)

> **Validation**
> 
> Aims to ensure that the software meets the needs of customers and other stakeholders. 
> 
> *Are we building the right thing?*

- Sample validation methods:
  - requirements reviews
  - prototyping
  - validation of analysis models
  - acceptance testing

> **Verification**
> 
> Aims to ensure that the software complies with the existing requirements, specifications, or regulations.
> 
> *Are we building it correctly?*

- Sample verification methods:
  - reviews
  - walkthroughs
  - inspections
  - testing
  - static code analysis
  - theorem proving
  - model checking

- Validation often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers while verification is an internal process.
- Software testing may address both verification and validation issues
  - validation
    - checks the observed results of test cases against the customer's needs
      - acceptance testing
  - verification
    - checks the observed results against
      - a specification (postcondition of a method)
      - the desirable and undesirable behavior from implicit requirements or expectations
