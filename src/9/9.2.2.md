# Test Cases

A test case is composed of
  - a context
    - the condition or configuration under which the test can be executed
  - one or more test inputs
    - action or procedure with input data, such as a method call or a UI interaction
  - corresponding test oracles
    - a test oracle consists of
      - expected result (oracle value) of input
      - comparison of the expected result with the actual result

## Positive, Negative, and Malicious Tests

- Positive Test
  - deals with only valid inputs
- Negative Test
  - deals with only *invalid* inputs
- Malicious Test
  - special type of negative test that attempts to break the software
  - e.g. SQL injection tests

To adequately test a program, negative tests usually outnumber positive tests. A ratio of 3:1 is not uncommon.

## Test Suites

A test suite is a set of test cases and/or test suites.

It's generally impossible to create a complete test suite that can exhaustively test a real-world program due to its large input space and possible execution paths. The design of a test suite often aims to select representative tests with a certain strategy.

## Pass and Fail

A failing test indicates that either:
  - the software under test is faulty
  - the test case itself is faulty

**A passing test doesn't guarantee correct software!**
