# Static Code Analysis

> **Static Code Analysis**
> 
> The analysis of source or binary code without actually executing the code. Analogous to automated code review.

Where compilers find syntax errors, SCA tools find software defects. They *do not* execute given code.

An SCA tool may build upon compiler or reverse engineering techniques for lexical and syntax analysis. It examines the parsed code from the perspectives of control flows or data flows and identifies potential problems according to specific features about what is good or bad.

> **Control Flow Analysis**
> 
> Uses control flow graphs or call graphs to reason about the order of statements or instructions and the possible execution paths.

> **Data flow analysis**
> 
> Examines how the variables (data) are computed and used across the basic code blocks, usually based on the CFGs.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been applied to SCA.

Here, the book covers the tools FindBugs and PMD. These are not listed on the final review sheet but appear on page 284-288 and in the Chapter 9 PowerPoint. There probably also won't be any questions about SCA via machine learning, but that info is on pages 289-290.
