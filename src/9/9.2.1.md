# Testing vs. Development Processes

## Testing Stages in Waterfall
In non-agile processes, testing of given production code is to execute the code with test cases to validate the requirements and find errors. This is usually led by a quality assurance group.

- Executes given production code with test cases to validate requirements and find errors
- Often performed by an independent testing team

Sample Process:
  - specify test requirements
  - create a test plan to meet constraints
    - computing resources, time, budget
  - design test cases to cover requirements
  - implement tests
    - manually perform or write/run test code
  - analyze test results and create reports

The testing process in Waterfall is often **destructive** because it attempts to break the software.
  - not in Agile/TDD: see below!
## Agile Processes

In Agile processes, testing is as integral to software development as coding.

Following agile principles, agile testing
  - ensures delivering the business value desired by the customer at frequent intervals
  - involves all members of a cross-functional team

In TDD, test cases are transformed into test code **before** the production code is written.

Compared to traditional testing, this process is **constructive** in that it builds up software.
