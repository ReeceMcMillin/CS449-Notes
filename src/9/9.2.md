> Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.

Assume that the program contains errors and then test the program to find as many errors as possible.

What makes a good test case?
  - A **good test** is one that has a high probability of detecting an as-yet undiscovered error.
  - A **successful test** is one that detects an error.
