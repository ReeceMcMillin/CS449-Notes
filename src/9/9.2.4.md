# Testing Strategies

## Black-Box Testing
- tests with no knowledge of internal workings
- typically tests features according to specification
- sample techniques (detail on p. 276):
  - equivalence partitioning
  - boundary value analysis
  - testing with pre/postconditions
  - model-based testing

## White-Box Testing
- uses knowledge about the code
- sample techniques (detail on p. 277):
  - code coverage-based testing
  - path testing
  - mutation testing
  - dynamic symbolic execution

## Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing
Fuzzing
  - black-box when generating test inputs from specification
  - white-box when generating test inputs from source code

Neither strategy is superior, each has advantages and disadvantages.

## Gray-Box Testing
- Example 1
  - *design* tests according to the code of multiple modules (white box)
  - *conduct* tests through the exposed interfaces (black box)
- Example 2
  - create and run tests according to pre/postcondition of a module (black box)
  - measure the code coverage (white box)
  - if code coverage doesn't meet goal, we can generate more tests from the code to exercise the uncovered statements or paths (white box)
